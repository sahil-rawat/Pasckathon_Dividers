## Description :
## Covid-19 Management System for Public Transportation Post Lockdown
### Open Innovation & Disaster Management


Our project is focusing on the current situation of covid 19. A Project solely for ensuring Peoples Saftey Post Covid-19 and to maintain social Distancing in more organized way.We Designed 2 Cross-Platform Application.

Firstly, For user Side where a user when registers on the app using his/her aadhar card ID he/she is allotted 3 Days of week The Person is allowed to go out on those particular days only, The App generates a Unique QR code for every user which is then Scanned by officials at the Public Transport Systems and If the person is allowed than the official allow them to board the public transport otherwise a fine is charged for not following the guidlines. This also ensures that no more than allowed people boards the public transport to ensure safety and social distancing within the Public Transport. This helps To reduce the crowd on Public Transportation Systems.

Secondly, For Authorities/Officials at the Public Transportation, This App Allowes the Officials to Scan the QR Code Generated by User App and if the Scanner verifies that the particular person is allowed on that day the official allows them to board the public Transport else the app automatically charges the fine from thatn user, This is to discourage the peoples not following guidelines.
